                        I am running to be next year's Swing Kids President because I firmly believe that the creative and social outlet that is our club deserves excellent, united leadership. My devotion to Swing Kids has been demonstrated by my full involvement with our club's activities, including lessons, social dancing, and bonding activities such as weekly team food. The experience I have this year as your Monday night dance coordinator has prepared me with important qualities that should be seen in an active president: commitment, energy, positivity, inclusivity, and a close relationship with the Swing Kids members themselves. I thank you for your vote, and I hope to be your president next year.

                        As President, I would like to increase UW's presence in the dance scene as well as give more learning opportunities to UW Swing Kids to work on dance. To accomplish this, I would like to look into having Lindy Hop exchanges with PLU, SU, and WWU. I have been talking with the leadership of those schools, and they would love to work with us to start an intercollegiate scene. I would also like to have dance workshops before our quarter dance and coordinate U-car rentals to take club members to dances.

                        I’m running to keep my seat as treasurer because
                        I want to  keep Swing Kids  a thriving, jiving club. As this year’s treasurer, I led officer meetings, earned Swing Kids’ highest revenue to date, interfaced between Swing Kids members and leadership, and made it a priority to create a celebratory and accepting environment in our club. I’m a team player, a go-getter, and a leader, and I’m ready for another year of monetary success! Stay classy, vote Casi!

                        I am running for the Monday Night Dance Coordinator! I believe I am beyond qualified with my experience as an event coordinator for the University of Hawaii where I planned big events (including a dance) for the university community to engage in. Part of my job was handling money, as in thousands of dollars to put on some of these events - so I'm very comfortable with balancing a budget. Basically, I'm very passionate about dancing and you guys are my pals so I want to see my pals every Monday, so please vote for me :)

                        Hey everyone! I’ve had a blast with all of you these past two years, and I would love to get more involved with the club! The Events Coordinator position appeals to me because I really enjoy organizing social get-togethers, and I am eager to give back to the swing community. I already have some crazy-super-awesome ideas for the events and dances, but I would also try and use ideas put out there by you lovely club members. Maintaining this position would mean a lot to me, but either way, I know I will be a part of the swing dance community for years to come!

                        I'm running for this position because I love swing kids (the club and y'all individually)! Swing has taken over my life in the best possible way providing me with lots of amazing friends and experiences, so now it's my turn to give back. I'd like to be part of the fabulous team that keeps Swing Kids going next year, making it awesome for the whole Swing Kids family and giving an extra warm welcome to all the newbies. I'm an organized gal so you all can be sure you can count on me to get things done - and book us the best rooms for lessons! Here's hoping I "swing" your vote my way!
