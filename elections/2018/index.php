                        Hi, I'm Alex! As a senior, next year will be my 4th year in the club and my 3rd year as an officer. Through my time with Swing Kids I have become proficient in leadership, organization, and time management. My priority is you, your concerns, and your experience in a club focused on community and fun. I will confidently represent the club and ensure the completion of administrative tasks, every time. As Lessons Coordinator, I effectively communicated with the HUB, other UW Administrative groups, and with all of you through email and Facebook. I have really enjoyed meeting and dancing with as many of you as I could at our Wednesday lessons, Monday night dances, and Team Food and look forward to welcoming new dancers in the coming year. I would like to have the privilege of being your President, contributing my years of experience to leading us through another successful year of swing dancing!

                        I've been a dedicated member of the swing community since 2016, and a member of Swing Kids since last year, and have loved every minute of it. Swing dancing offered me a community of fun and welcoming people to laugh and dance with, and I want to share that kind of joy with as many people as possible. As one half of the current Events coordinator team, I'm familiar with how Swing Kids works, and can help run and/or direct the club to fit its member's needs and wants. I am also the current publicity director for a theatre company on campus, and am very familiar with how to market events, coordinate teams, and complete and organize tasks in a timely and efficient manner. Aside from that, I am a lindy hopper at heart, and I absolutely adore jazz music and dancing, and want to spread the lindy love as far as it can go. Vote for me!
